The Viral Dark Matter user interface is a web site that interfaces with a database at San Diego State University that allows users to upload experimental information straight to the database.

09/16/2013
	Currently VDM site starting the 2.0 alpha edition
	- Database level are modulized. 
	- Javascript/JQuery codes are functional classified.

TODO: 
	X Mutex user's ability to click vcid and bactid
	X Replicate: auto increment upon data entry.  Associated only with order of entry.  (Each file gets its own replicate number)..
		• PROPOSAL for files and replicates: 
			° When a new file is uploaded, input_uploader.php checks to see if a file has already been uploaded with that EDT# via filename.  
			° Problems: If not every file has an EDT associated with it, I will start hitting biologists.  
			° Alternative: The VCID could be looked up for each file, and those without EDT's could sub in VCID.
			° Question: What needs to be in file table, just EDT, just VCID, both, and/or Replicate number?

	X Add date from file to file table, show date + filename + plate/replicate when selecting VCID on view
	-* Allow insertion/deletion of 
		• Files
		X bact/vcid/etc
		° plates
		° supplements
		° bases
		• etc?

	X average the replicates
	- recent upload section with name file date/time of experiment and upload
	X change visualization of deviation from two graphs to vertical lines
	X Select average/deviation from subset of viewed clones (via date)
	- Single plate reader 

	- mouse over shows supplement information - change source from file to db
	-* Associate replicates with their plate (view)

	- Table (from jeremy's excel) that shows metabolomic data, phenotype microarray, neural network prediction from "Rosetta Stone", store in table
	- Tables for metabolomic data in database
	- add genotype to bacteria table


	5/2/12
	- Progress page: view only list of bacterial external id with its VCID (link to rosetta stone, how many phenotype microarrays have been uploaded, mouse-over pop-up shows bacterium, genotype (need info)
		• PM Data table with number of reps for each plate (link to pm view page)
		• Metabolomics (link to metabolomics view)

Personal Weekly Goals:

	5/27
	HQ: 

	Nick: Get HQ familiar with github, and figure out plan for migrating to new database.
